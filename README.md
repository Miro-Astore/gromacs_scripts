# gromacs_scripts
assorted scripts for working with gromacs, mostly system building with some mdp files for membrane simulations.

TODO. Add automation for detection of ligands to genrestr_sequence.sh so you don't need seperate scripts for each ligand/molecule class. 
TODO. Change top2psf.pl to detect segname from top file
